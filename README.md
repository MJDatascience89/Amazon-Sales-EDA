## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section explores the relationships between different features, including:

- **Distributions:** Visualizes the distributions of key variables like discounted price, actual price, rating count, and ratings.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Examines correlations between features using a heatmap.
- **Categorical Analysis:** Explores average discounts and ratings across different product categories and sub-categories.
- **Price Analysis:** Analyzes average prices across categories.

# Sentiment Analysis

The notebook utilizes the VADER sentiment analysis tool to analyze customer reviews.  It preprocesses review text and calculates sentiment scores, categorizes reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment, and visualizes the distribution of sentiment scores. Word clouds for positive and negative product names visualize frequently mentioned terms.

# Key Findings and Insights

- The analysis reveals insights into product pricing, discount strategies, customer sentiment towards product categories, and top-rated products.
- The code provides specific observations such as strong correlations between discounted and actual prices and identifies product categories or sub-categories that require attention due to lower average ratings or customer sentiment scores.
- Price elasticity is calculated, suggesting potential pricing strategies.
